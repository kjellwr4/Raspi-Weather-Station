# Information
This repository contains steps for building a weather station using a Raspberry Pi 3. The weather station collects measurements that include temperature, humidity, pressure, rain, wind speed, and wind direction. Additional weather data points include dew point and heat index, but these are computed values from the aforementioned measurements. All of the collected information is sent to a Google Sheet for storage and analysis.

The instructions borrow heavily from the [Build your own weather station](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station) tutorial written by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Inspiration and credit goes to the people who shared their initial plans.
